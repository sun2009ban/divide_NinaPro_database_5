# divide_NinaPro_database_5
This repository contain the code we used to divide NinaPro database 5 into train set and test set 

Step 1: make new directories named "raw_data" and "processed_data"

Step 2: Download the NinaPro Dataset 5 at http://ninaweb.hevs.ch/ and unzip the data to "raw_data"

Step3: run the ninaweb_sEMG_envelop.py to divide the 70% data as train set and the rest 30% as test set.

Or run the ninaweb_sEMG_envelop_divide_by_subject.py to divide data from 7 subjects as train set and the rest 3 subjects as test set.
